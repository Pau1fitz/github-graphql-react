# React-Github 💻👩‍💻💽👨‍💻

This is `React-Github`, a React front end client that communicates with the Github GraphQL API.

See it in action [here](http://pau1fitz.github.io/react-github).

If you wish to run the code locally run the following. Before this you will need to deploy [Heroku Gatekeeper](https://github.com/prose/gatekeeper#deploy-on-heroku) with the appropriate Github client id and client secret.

```
yarn
yarn start
visit http://localhost:3000
```
